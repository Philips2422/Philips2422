## Hi there 👋
I am Shaun, a BOSCH trained [Technische Universität Hamburg](https://www.tuhh.de/tuhh/en/studying/before-studying/degree-courses/international-study-programs/microelectronics-and-microsystems) prospect, deeply in pursuit of experience and growth.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [MPC] (Efficient_Collision-Avoidance_Constraints_for_Elli.pdf)model predictive control-based obstacle avoidance.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Julia for image processing and advanced techniques of IC design.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on Powertrain solutions, predictive control systems, and semiconductor fabrications.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I strongly believe AI has put an end to the world of the curious.
